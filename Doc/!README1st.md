#The Doc Directory

This directory is for those wishing to not only learn how the Manual project is built, but also want to gain a better understanding of how a Mac application can be built. If you already well understand how to develop a Mac or iOS application, then you may not need to spend your time in this directory. But, just in case ... :0]

The directory consists of Apple documentation as well as documentation  developer-developed.

Just take some time and go through the related documents and see if any of them or of any use to your efforts in understanding how Manual is organized.
